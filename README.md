# Bankruptcy_Prediction
Using AI and machine learning, classified a bankruptcy dataset which has 6 different attributes and 251 records, into bankrupt and not-bankrupt. We used Decision tree classifier, Naive Bayesian classifier, Support Vector machine classifier and Neural Network classifier models to classify the dataset.
